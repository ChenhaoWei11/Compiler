WHILE Language Token Parser and Lexer

Overview

This project is designed to extend the parser introduced in lectures by moving from processing strings to processing tokens. It leverages Scala to implement a custom parser capable of interpreting tokens generated by a lexer. This lexer, built upon the regular expressions (Rexp), processes specific patterns of characters and converts them into tokenized representations suitable for parsing.

Features

Lexer
The lexer converts raw input strings into tokens based on predefined regular expressions (Rexp). These tokens are categorized based on language-specific keywords, operators, numbers, identifiers, and other essential elements of the WHILE language.

Parser
The parser processes these tokens and converts them into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) based on the WHILE programming language. The parser supports basic syntax structures, such as loops (while, for), conditionals (if-then-else), assignments, and I/O operations (e.g., read, write).

Key Components
Rexp (Regular Expressions): Core building blocks for token definitions.
Val (Values): Custom value types representing parsed tokens.
Token Filtering: The lexer removes whitespace and comments to streamline the parsing process.
Token Parsers: Custom parsers for different tokens such as identifiers, numbers, and strings.
Extensions
Several language extensions were implemented, including:

Support for additional operators (+, -, *, %, etc.)
Lexing capabilities for identifiers, numbers, and strings
Support for block structures like if-else and while loops
Example Usage
Lexical Analysis: The lexer takes a raw input string, processes it based on regular expressions, and generates a list of tokens.
scala

val sourceCode = """
  while (x < 10) {
    x := x + 1;
    write(x);
  }
"""
val tokens = lexing_simp(WHILE_REGS, sourceCode)
Parsing: The parser processes the list of tokens and produces an AST representing the program's structure.
scala

val ast = WhileParser.parse_all(tokens)
